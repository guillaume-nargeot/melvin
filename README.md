What kevin should have been, rewritten from the bottom up. Uses machines. I hope it catches on.

* To authenticate, set your nick to your deviantART username and the server password to your dA password.
* Private chats are regular channels of the form `&username`. To start a private chat with somebody, just `/join &their_username`. Remember, the other person can't see your messages unless they are also in the channel.
* Admin commands are of the form `/admin #room admin command to send`. For example, `/admin #Botdom show privclass Bots`. If you're using irssi, weechat, or a similar client, you might need to send `/quote admin #room command`.
